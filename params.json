Visual content is one of the most universal content that can reach different cultures no matter the education level. I decided to launch this project as my first collaborative project so people around the world know where we Malagasy people come from.\r\nCeci est un projet collaboratif dont le but est de raconter l'histoire de l'île de Madagascar à travers les images et l'interactivité. De nos jours, le contenu visuel est l'une des voie de communications les plus universelles, transcendant ainsi les differentes cultures sans tenir compte du niveau d'éducation.\r\n\r\n### Collaborators\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@novapixels ...for now",
